#### Performed Anomaly detection on NAB data

#### The Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) is a novel benchmark for evaluating algorithms for anomaly detection in streaming, online applications. It is comprised of over 50 labeled real-world and artificial timeseries data files plus a novel scoring mechanism designed for real-time applications.

#### Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab

#### I've applied anomaly detecting model on realKnownCause dataset "machine_temperature_system_failure.csv"

#### Distribution of temperature pattern over the years
